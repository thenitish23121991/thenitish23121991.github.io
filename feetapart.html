I worked as the Lead Product Designer with Feetapart(on a contract basis) to redesign some of the key features of their app. I managed a team of 2 graphic designers, a UX researcher and a motion designer. I was responsible for the overall UI/UX design changes on the app.

<div class="para_body">

Feetapart is a gamification based health and wellness platform that offers exciting rewards to you for walking steps. For every step you walk, the pedometer turns your steps walked into a currency called Feetcoins, which can then be spent to redeem exciting rewards.

<div class="para_body">

<div class="para_body">
Feetapart was struggling with their products redemption rates with their existing store. They had some worrying data about user's engagement with their store, some of the users also told them they did not even know that they can redeem a product.

Our assumption for the lack of users trust in the app was because the visual design of the app was not very professional. Users did not 


There were a few generic visual design issues throughout the app, the icons throughout the app were not cohesive, had different stroke widths and stroke radiuses throughout the app. We started by building a cohesive icons system with well defined characteristics to be followed for future icons. In the first iteration, we replaced the existing icons throughout the app with our new icons.

</div>

<div class="para_body">

We found that the navigation bar was ambigious, especially for the newer users, hence we added corresponding text labels to the icons in the navigation bar.

For gathering further insights on the store of the app, we gave a set of 5 users a task to be performed. The users would have to walk for a while to earn some feetcoins and then go to the app store and redeem rewards that they find exciting(or relevant to them).

<div class="para_body">

We finalised on a couple of directions we can work further on, I mocked up both the approaches to have further discussion on. One of the approaches was to use a tabular structure with the available rewards and the redeemed rewards being the two tabs. The another approach was to use chips to show the most relevant products to the user straight away and allow a quick filter with chips to browse through the products that were close to them, unlocked for them etc. This is the approach we felt solved our problems in an elegent way.

We built on the Chips approach with further testing this users, we found that the gender of the user, how far away the product was from the user(location) and what products they could already redeem were the factors that made a product desirable for the users, hence we showed these filters as the easiest filters to be applied.

<div class="para_body">

We mocked up the chips approach, created a prototype and began testing this prototype with our target users. In our approach, we had decided to hide the feetcoins balance on the store screen to make sure that the scrolling of products on the screen was uninterruptive and smooth. Another assumption we made was that the low feetcoins balance could demotivate users. But while testing, we realised that it was too complicated for the users to calculate the feetcoins

<div class="para_body">

Feetapart launched the new store on 1st January, 2020 and based on the analytics we recorded for the first week as well as the messages received from power users, it was an instant success. The products redemption rate grew by ~900%, more than 16% of the total users checked a product out on the store. The change was also reflected in the rating scores users gave to the Feetapart app on the Google Play Store. The rating improved from a score of 3.3 to 4.2 within the first 3 weeks of launch. As a result of this impact, the Feetapart app trended on #3 in the Fitness Category on the Play Store for a week.

The "New Arrivals" category is the stand out element on the store and hence is animated with the slowest timing function, so that the attention of the user is diverted to it.
