Crosschecks is an application that attempts to curb the car theft crimes in New Delhi. The application offers 3 different interfaces for Guards, for securing the housing societies in Delhi, Police Officials, attempting to solve car theft cases and catching car thieves and the Residents, who upload details about their vehicles that help the guards and the police identify their vehicles and contact owners in case of an emergency.

<div class="para_body">

The gated colonies in Delhi have a long history of vehicle thefts. Most of the thefts take place at night, mostly during the 2 AM - 5 AM window. To tackle this problem, we wanted to verify the identity of every vehicle that left a particular colony at night and only allow him/her to leave once their identity was confirmed. At a time when the OTP confirmation pattern was already well used and well understood in India, verifying the identity of the driver with an OTP seemed like an obvious solution to this problem. 


<div>

<br/>

<div class="para_body">

We decided to create a mechanism to verify the identity of the driver of every vehicle that checks out of a colony at night(mostly during 11:00 PM-5:00 AM bracket) with an OTP which would be sent to all the owners listed on the app for that particular vehicle. In case the driver of the vehicle is not verified with the OTP, the owner of the vehicle is contacted in an attempt to verify the driver. If the security guard at the colony gate is unable to verify the identity of the driver through all the methods, either a new OTP is resent or the police are alerted about that vehicle.

<div class="para_body">

When we were building the Crosschecks app, car safety apps hand't taken off in India yet, however the OTP usage patterns in India were something to learn from. The pattern of receiving and entering/matching the OTP was already very familiar with all stratas of society in India. We were confident that the security guards would be able to use this method to confirm the identity of the driver of the vehicle with ease.

<p>
Due to slow mobile networks, an OTP might be received on a delay. One of the concerns were that an OTP message might get lost easily due to high number of spam messages received on certain networks.

<div>The Guards App</div>


</div>


<div class="para_body">
We started off by designing the app for guards, since it was most central to achieving the goal of reducing/stopping the car thefts. With the help of this app, security guards confirm the identity of the drivers of the vehicles in the late night time slot(11 PM - 5 AM in most cases) and if the driver tries to flee the spot, with the help of the alert button, the guards can inform the nearest police station about the car theft.

<div class="para_body">

We interacted with the security guards to get to know the kind of devices they use, how they use their devices and how their shift usually works, especially at night. We found out following key insights that helped us design an easy to use and efficient app for them:



<div class="para_list_container">

<ul>


<li>
Most of the guards used low end android devices.
</li>




<li>
Since a lot of them were older in age, a lot of them had visibility issues. Most of them had a lower vision than an average person.
</li>



<li>
They were already quite familiar with the pattern of receiving an OTP(One time password) and entering it on the screen.
</li>



</ul>

<div class="para dark_background">

<div class="para_title_1">Sketching out some options</div>
<div class="para_title_2">Some initial sketching</div>

<div class="para_body">

Some sketches we developed early in the process for each of the applications. These cover the UX and the flow of the applications briefly. While creating the sketches for the app, we encountered a key question regarding the use case for this app: What happens if while the guard is generating an OTP for a car, another car appears and the driver is looking to get verified? 

<br/>
<br/>

<div>

This is a very real possibility since the there is sometimes a delay in receiving an OTP on devices in India due to a poor network. We tried to solve this problem by adding a way for the guard to create multiple OTPs at the same time. The guards can easily switch back and from different cars that might get collected at the gate at a particular time.

<div class="para_body">
As most of the vehicle thefts take place during the night, and therefore the workload for the security guards increases significantly during the night it was natural to have a night theme for the app. This was especially important for the app meant for the guards as most of the workers are old aged and have lower vision than most of the people.

<div class="para_body">

To log the guards in, we use 2-step authentication using a code and a password. All the security guards at the colonies are provided with a code and password setup for them that they can use to login into the app. Once they are logged in succesfully, they are greeted with the home screen, where they can quickly create an OTP for a car.

We conducted a trial of the app before making it live to see if there are some improvements that could be made to the app. While testing, we realised that an average user received a large number of spam messages on their mobile phones. Along with this, we observed that even while the OTP was sent successfully to the owner of the car, sometimes, the guards would fumble in finding the message containing the OTP for the correct car in their message box or would enter the wrong OTP due to not hearing it properly. Therefore we decided to make it easier for the guards to re-enter the OTP in case they have entered it wrong.

<div class="para_body">
Crosschecks is designed to prevent the theft of vehicles from housing societies in New Delhi. These societies are particularly vulnerable during night. The App is designed for Guards, Car Owners and Police Officials. The Guards use the app to ensure that the vehicles leaving and arriving at the society are of valid owners. They generate an OTP for that particular car and then match that with the OTP received by the driver. If the OTP is not matched, the Guard contacts the vehicle owner and verifies the identity of the driver. In case of a failure, the Guard can inform the nearest Police Station for a vehicle theft.

The Police officials use the app to get a dynamic list of all the vehicles reported stolen in their designated zone. With a list of details about the vehicles stolen, the officials can perform a check on any suspicious vehicle they find, much like guards. They also generate an OTP and confirm it with the driver of the vehicle. If the OTP is not matched, the police official establish contact with the designated police station. The list is dynamic and updates with each theft reported. Color is a key component for the officials to track and identify a vehicle in the real world. The color code for a vehicle on the app is matched with the exact color of a particular model. Using typographical heirarchy, the vehicle name is made easy to scan.

The most critical component of the Guard and the Police App was the Confirm-Reject widget. This widget indicates the most crucial action of confirming or rejecting the owner of the vehicles by the guards and police officials. We used traditional colors for indicating a confirm and reject action. The colors differ in saturation as well as brightness enabling people with color blindness to easily differentiate between them. The text label alongside it ensures that people with disabilities understand the action associated with the buttons.

<p>
  
While designing the icon for alert action, we decided to use the a tilted alert icon alongside the default call icon on android to ensure that the overall message is still neutral. This ensures that the icon does not have a negative outlook either.
